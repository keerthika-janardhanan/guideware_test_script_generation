# ESAN Video Narration - Accurate Timing (6:40 total)

## 0:00 - 0:23 (Opening & Design Click)

Welcome to ESAN, where artificial intelligence meets test automation.

Testing enterprise applications used to take weeks, but we've changed that with generative AI.

I'm clicking the Design option to start creating a new automation workflow.

## 0:23 - 0:39 (Providing Recorder Details)

Now I'm providing the recorder details, workflow name and description.

This helps organize our automation library.

## 0:39 - 0:43 (Recorder Preparing)

The recorder is preparing the environment.

## 0:43 - 1:51 (Chromium Launched - Actions Performed)

Chromium browser has launched.

Now watch as I perform the manual workflow naturally, clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages.

Behind the scenes, ESAN uses Playwright technology to capture every action in real time.

It's recording not just what I click, but the DOM elements, which are the building blocks of web pages, so it knows exactly where each button and field is located.

The intelligent recorder captures smart locators that can adapt even if the page design changes.

No coding knowledge required, just perform your task as you normally would.

Every click, every input, every navigation is being captured with context.

This is the foundation of our AI powered automation.

## 1:51 - 1:57 (Recorder Ingestion into Vector DB)

Recording complete.

Now the captured workflow is being ingested into our Vector Database.

This is where the AI magic happens, the recording is converted into embeddings, which are mathematical representations that our Large Language Model can understand and learn from.

## 1:57 - 1:58 (Choose Next Option - Selected Automation)

Choosing the next option, I'm selecting Automation to generate executable scripts.

## 1:58 - 2:06 (Repo Details)

Providing repository details.

Think of a repository as a secure library for code, where all automation scripts are stored and version controlled.

## 2:06 - 2:12 (Repo Cloning)

The system is cloning the repository, fetching the latest code structure.

## 2:12 - 2:15 (Choose Path - Refined Recorder Flow)

Now it asks: use existing script or refined recorder flow?

I'm selecting refined recorder flow since this is a new workflow.

## 2:15 - 2:32 (Refined Flow Preview - Editable)

Here's the refined flow preview showing all captured steps.

Notice you can edit these steps if needed, maybe add validations or adjust wait times.

Here's the intelligent part: our Large Language Model, the brain behind generative AI, considers your edits as feedback.

This is Agentic AI, an autonomous system that learns and adapts based on your input, making automation smarter with every interaction.

## 2:32 - 2:45 (Generated Test Script)

And here it is, the generated Playwright automation script.

Production ready code, properly formatted, following industry best practices.

What would take hours to write manually, our AI generated in seconds using RAG technology, Retrieval Augmented Generation, pulling patterns from our Vector Database.

## 2:45 - 3:19 (Test Manager Configuration)

Now the test manager configuration.

I'm updating the test case ID, specifying the test data sheet, and configuring test data references.

Notice I'm setting this to parallel mode.

This test manager Excel file is the key to data driven testing.

Each row represents a different test scenario with unique credentials or reference IDs.

Instead of running tests one by one sequentially, ESAN will launch multiple browser instances simultaneously.

This is how we achieve seventy percent faster execution.

## 3:19 - 3:23 (Trial Run Clicked)

Clicking trial run to validate the automation.

## 3:23 - 4:16 (Trial Run - Parallel Execution)

Trial run started, watch as parallel execution happens.

Two Chromium browsers launching simultaneously, this is the power of parallel processing.

Browser one is executing with its own unique test data.

Browser two is running completely independently with different test data.

Notice how both browsers are performing the exact same recorded actions, but each with their own credentials and inputs.

This is true parallel execution, multiple test scenarios running at the same time instead of waiting for each one to finish.

Each execution is completely isolated in its own browser instance, so they don't interfere with each other.

Watch as ESAN automatically captures everything, screenshots at every step for visual verification, execution traces for debugging, and detailed logs for analysis.

All test steps are executing, form validations are running, navigation flows are being tested, and results are being collected in real time.

The execution engine monitors each browser independently, tracking pass fail status, capturing any errors, and aggregating all results.

This is how ESAN transforms testing from a slow sequential process into a fast parallel operation, dramatically reducing overall test execution time.

## 4:16 - 4:27 (Pushed to Git)

Trial run success, all tests passed.

Now pushing the automation script to Git, which is a version control system.

The script is now safely stored, version controlled, and ready for production.

Anyone on the team can access it with a complete history of changes.

## 4:27 - 4:38 (Two Option Cards)

After completing automation, ESAN shows two options: generate manual test cases for documentation, or complete the task.

This is our dual agent AI system.

Agent Two just created the automation script.

Now let's see Agent One generate manual test cases.

## 4:38 - 4:45 (Upload Template)

I'm uploading a template that defines the format for test cases.

Clicking generate.

## 4:45 - 5:08 (Test Cases Generating - Silent Processing)

Our first AI agent, powered by a Large Language Model, is analyzing the entire workflow.

It's not just copying what we did, it's understanding the intent.

The AI generates comprehensive test cases including positive scenarios where everything works correctly, negative scenarios for error handling, and edge cases for unusual situations.

The AI thinks like a QA engineer, anticipating what could go wrong and how to test for it.

## 5:08 - 5:30 (Test Cases Generated - Viewed Sheet)

Test cases generated.

Opening the downloaded test case sheet.

Look at this, detailed test cases with clear descriptions, step by step instructions, expected results, and test data.

Comprehensive and ready to share with your team or stakeholders.

All generated automatically from our single recording.

This is the power of our dual agent AI system: Agent One creates human readable documentation, Agent Two creates executable automation, both from the same recording.

## 5:30 - 5:35 (All Tasks Completed - Jump to Homepage)

All tasks completed.

Returning to the homepage.

## 5:35 - 5:38 (Clicked Execute)

Now let me show you the Execute component, where you run automation scripts on demand.

Clicking Execute.

## 5:38 - 5:40 (Selected Automation Flow)

Selecting automation flow.

## 5:40 - 5:44 (Selection from Recorded Workflow)

Choosing from our recorded workflows.

I'm selecting the workflow we just automated.

## 5:44 - 5:54 (Repo Configuration)

Providing repository details to fetch the latest changes.

This ensures we're always running the most up to date automation script.

## 5:54 - 5:59 (Choose Path - Existing Script)

Choose your path: since we already have an existing script, I'm selecting that option.

This shows how easy it is to reuse automation for regression testing.

## 5:59 - 6:06 (Review Script)

Reviewing the script before execution.

Everything looks good, the automation is ready to run.

## 6:06 - 6:20 (Update Test Manager with Test Data)

Now updating the test manager Excel with fresh test data.

Maybe different user accounts, different business scenarios, or different environments.

This is data driven testing, one script, unlimited test scenarios.

Simply change the input data to test different cases.

## 6:20 - 6:40 (Trial Run - Parallel Execution)

Clicking trial run.

Execution starting, multiple Chromium browsers launching in parallel.

Each browser runs the same test but with its own unique test data.

The execution looks the same as the previous trial run, demonstrating how easily you can rerun the same automation with different test data.

This is the power of ESAN, record once, execute unlimited times with any dataset.

## 6:40 - End (Closing)

And that's ESAN in action.

Capture your workflow once using our intelligent Playwright recorder.

Our dual agent AI system generates both documentation and automation scripts.

Execute tests in parallel with different data for comprehensive coverage.

No coding required, just record, generate, and execute.

Thank you for watching.
