# ESAN - Simple Presentation Script

## THE PROBLEM

"Testing enterprise applications is time-consuming and repetitive. QA teams spend weeks writing test scripts manually, maintaining them as applications change, and running them sequentially—which means critical bugs slip through, releases get delayed, and teams burn out doing the same tasks over and over."

---

## THE SOLUTION - ESAN

"ESAN solves this with AI-powered automation. Instead of writing scripts manually, you simply record your workflow once. Our dual-agent AI system automatically generates both manual test documentation and production-ready Playwright automation scripts.

Instead of maintaining scripts as applications change, our Agentic AI uses RAG technology with Vector Database—learning from previous recordings to generate smarter, more resilient automation.

Instead of sequential execution that takes hours, our parallel execution engine runs tests seventy percent faster by launching multiple browsers simultaneously with different test data.

ESAN turns days of manual work into minutes of autonomous testing—no coding required."

## RECORDER

"Let's talk about the Recorder. When you perform a manual workflow, Playwright captures every action as JSON data. This recording feeds into our dual-agent AI system.

We have two paths: Automation and Manual.

For the Manual path, Agent One uses a Large Language Model to analyze your workflow and generates human-readable test cases for documentation.

For the Automation path, Agent Two - our Agentic AI - generates Playwright automation scripts. It queries our Vector Database using RAG technology to retrieve similar patterns from previous recordings, making the generated code smarter and more optimized.

So from one recording, you get both manual test documentation and production-ready automation scripts."

## EXECUTE

"Now the Execute component. Once the automation script is generated, the Execution Engine takes over.

It loads your test data from Excel or JSON files and launches multiple browser instances in parallel. Each browser runs the same recorded script but with different test data - for example, different user credentials or reference IDs.

All browsers execute simultaneously, cutting execution time by seventy percent. Each captures results, screenshots, and traces. Everything aggregates into a unified dashboard showing pass-fail status.

So Execute takes your recorded script and runs it multiple times with different test data in parallel."

## SUMMARY

"In summary: The Recorder captures new workflows and converts them into both manual test cases and automation scripts using our dual-agent AI system. The Execute component then runs those automation scripts multiple times in parallel with different test data, giving you fast, comprehensive test coverage."
